# salesforce-project

A Garage Management System (GMS) Salesforce project is designed to streamline the operations of a garage by integrating customer relationship management (CRM) with essential functions like vehicle maintenance, inventory management, scheduling, and invoicing. The project leverages Salesforce features such as Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and custom components built with Apex and Visualforce to manage customer profiles, service requests, and repair schedules. It enables efficient tracking of spare parts inventory, automates invoice generation, and provides insightful reports and analytics for better decision-making. With a focus on improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer experience, the system helps garages manage appointments, communicate with customers, and maintain accurate records, all while offering data-driven insights for continuous improvement.
